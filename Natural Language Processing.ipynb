    "### 1. **Text Processing:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. **Tokenization:**\n",
    "   - **Theory:** Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into individual units, usually words or sentences.\n",
    "   - **Math Approach:** It involves using regular expressions or specialized tokenization libraries.\n",
    "   - **Algorithm:**\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\n",
    "     text = \"Tokenization is an important step in NLP.\"\n",
    "     tokens = word_tokenize(text)\n",
    "     print(tokens)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - **Example:** Output will be `['Tokenization', 'is', 'an', 'important', 'step', 'in', 'NLP', '.']`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b. **Stop Words Removal:**\n",
    "   - **Theory:** Stop words are common words (e.g., \"the\", \"and\") that often do not contribute much to the meaning of a text.\n",
    "   - **Math Approach:** Stop words are removed based on predefined lists.\n",
    "   - **Algorithm:**\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     from nltk.corpus import stopwords\n",
    "     stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))\n",
    "     filtered_tokens = [word for word in tokens if word.lower() not in stop_words]\n",
    "     print(filtered_tokens)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - **Example:** Output will be `['Tokenization', 'important', 'step', 'NLP', '.']`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### c. **Stemming and Lemmatization:**\n",
    "   - **Theory:** Stemming and lemmatization aim to reduce words to their base or root form.\n",
    "   - **Math Approach:** Stemming uses heuristic rules, while lemmatization involves dictionary-based approaches.\n",
    "   - **Algorithm:**\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer, WordNetLemmatizer\n",
    "     porter = PorterStemmer()\n",
    "     lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()\n",
    "     stemmed_words = [porter.stem(word) for word in tokens]\n",
    "     lemmatized_words = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(word) for word in tokens]\n",
    "     print(stemmed_words)\n",
    "     print(lemmatized_words)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - **Example:** Output will be `['token', 'is', 'an', 'import', 'step', 'in', 'nlp', '.']` for stemming and `['Tokenization', 'is', 'an', 'important', 'step', 'in', 'NLP', '.']` for lemmatization.\n"

    "### PorterStemmer:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Stemming:**\n",
    "   - **Goal:** Reducing words to their base or root form by removing suffixes.\n",
    "   - **Method:** Employs a set of heuristic rules to strip off prefixes and suffixes.\n",
    "   - **Example:**\n",
    "     - **Input:** \"running\"\n",
    "     - **Output:** \"run\"\n",
    "   - **Use Case:** It tends to be more aggressive and faster, making it suitable for information retrieval or other tasks where speed is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Algorithm:**\n",
    "   - **Porter Stemming Algorithm:** Developed by Martin Porter.\n",
    "   - **Math Approach:** Employs a series of rules for suffix stripping.\n",
    "   - **Example (in Python):**\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer\n",
    "     porter = PorterStemmer()\n",
    "     print(porter.stem(\"running\"))  # Output: run\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### WordNetLemmatizer:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lemmatization:**\n",
    "   - **Goal:** Reducing words to their base or dictionary form (lemma).\n",
    "   - **Method:** Utilizes a vocabulary and morphological analysis to achieve the base form.\n",
    "   - **Example:**\n",
    "     - **Input:** \"running\"\n",
    "     - **Output:** \"run\"\n",
    "   - **Use Case:** It provides a more accurate transformation and is often preferred when the focus is on obtaining the actual dictionary word.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Algorithm:**\n",
    "   - **WordNet Lemmatizer Algorithm:** Relies on WordNet, a lexical database of the English language.\n",
    "   - **Math Approach:** Utilizes morphological analysis and a word lexicon.\n",
    "   - **Example (in Python):**\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer\n",
    "     lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()\n",
    "     print(lemmatizer.lemmatize(\"running\", pos='v'))  # Output: run\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     Note: The `pos` parameter indicates the part of speech; 'v' stands for verb.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Aggressiveness:** PorterStemmer is generally more aggressive, which means it might produce more truncated words compared to WordNetLemmatizer.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Accuracy:** WordNetLemmatizer is considered more accurate as it uses a dictionary-based approach, but it can be slower than PorterStemmer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Part-of-Speech Handling:** WordNetLemmatizer allows you to specify the part of speech, which can be important for languages like English where the same word may function as different parts of speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Case:** Choose between them based on the specific requirements of your NLP task. If speed is crucial and you can tolerate some over-stemming, PorterStemmer might be more suitable. If accuracy and obtaining valid dictionary words are more critical, WordNetLemmatizer is a better choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the choice between `PorterStemmer` and `WordNetLemmatizer` depends on the specific needs of your NLP application, considering factors such as speed, accuracy, and the importance of valid dictionary words in the output."

    "     ```python\n",
    "     from nltk import ngrams\n",
    "     bigrams = list(ngrams(tokens, 2))\n",
    "     print(bigrams)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - **Example:** Output will be a list of bigrams from the input tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b. **Word Embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe):**\n",
    "   - **Theory:** Word embeddings represent words as dense vectors in a continuous vector space.\n",
    "   - **Math Approach:** Trained using neural networks to capture semantic relationships.\n",
    "   - **Algorithm (using Gensim for Word2Vec):**\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     from gensim.models import Word2Vec\n",
    "     model_w2v = Word2Vec(sentences=[tokens], vector_size=100, window=5, min_count=1, workers=4)\n",
    "     word_embedding = model_w2v.wv['Tokenization']\n",
    "     print(word_embedding)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - **Example:** Output will be a vector representation of the word \"Tokenization\" in the trained Word2Vec model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Syntax and Semantics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. **Part-of-speech Tagging:**\n",
    "   - **Theory:** Part-of-speech tagging assigns grammatical categories (e.g., noun, verb) to words in a sentence.\n",
